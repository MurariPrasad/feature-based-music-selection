This is actually a small web app intended towards a proof check of our POC developed in the paper mentioned above.
Our goal was to find a way of using self extracted features from a audio file, and use them to compare the similarity between them.
This similarity is completely unbiased in terms of genre, artist, release date, etc.

The project uses a transfer-learned architecture for an autoencoder, whose latent vector is used as the self-extracted feature vector 
for the audio files.
